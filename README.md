# 🦠 U.S. COVID-19 Demographic Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 across U.S. states using demographic and medical data. The goal is to uncover patterns in case and death rates and build predictive models for mortality based on underlying factors like age, ethnicity, comorbidities, and healthcare capacity.

The project blends data science and public health to support data-driven decision-making and highlight disparities in health outcomes.

## 🔧 Features

- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand distributions and trends
- Performed **hypothesis testing** to validate correlations between variables (e.g., age vs. death rate)
- Built **regression models** to predict COVID-19 death rates based on demographic and health indicators
- Created **interactive visualizations** using **Tableau** to communicate key findings
- Evaluated model performance using statistical metrics (R², RMSE)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Model Evaluation)  
- Tableau  
- Statistical Testing (t-tests, correlation analysis)  

---

## 📈 Results

- Identified **age**, **pre-existing conditions**, and **ethnic group proportions** as major predictors of COVID-19 mortality
- Regression model explained a significant portion of the variance in death rates across states
- Visual dashboards allowed for **interactive filtering** by region, population, and healthcare capacity
- Insights can help target public health interventions and allocate resources more effectively
